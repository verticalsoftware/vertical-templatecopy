t4copy - A program that creates files and folders according to a structured template.

USAGE

	t4copy.exe [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION

	t4copy creates a directory structure with files that are based off of a template. At its core, it copies the files and folder structure from a directory that serves as a template that contains files and child structures. Along with copying the assets, it is capable of performing substitutions using command line variables or expansion via macros.

OPTIONS

	-a | --arg-pattern

		A regular expression that matches user provided variable expansions in template files. Defaults to a pattern that matches strings like $(<key>), where <key> is a capture group that extracts the variable name.

	--clean-and-overwrite
		
		A purposely long switch that indicates the output directory should be emptied (recusively) if it contains any items. The program will not copy a template to the output directory unless it is empty, unless this switch is specified.
		** WARNING: If you invoke this switch, the contents of the directory will be unrecoverably deleted.

	-e | --env-pattern <PATTERN>

		A regular expression that matches environment variable expansions in template files. Defaults to a pattern that matches strings like $(env:<key>), where <key> is a capture group that extracts the environment variable name.

	-l | --logger <LEVEL>

		Logger verbosity level. Specify [v]erbose, [d]ebug, [[i]nfo]rmation, or [q]uiet - defaults to info.

	-m | --macro-pattern <PATTERN>

		A regular expression that matches macro expansions in template files. Defaults to a pattern that matches strings like $(@<fn>(<arg>)), where <fn> and <arg> are named capture groups that extract the macro name and argument value, respectively.

	-o | --output <PATH>

		The directory that serves as the root of the output.

	-t | --template <PATH>

		The path to the template structure.	

	-v | --var <KEY=VALUE> [...]

		Passes along a key/value pair to the process variables collection.
		KEY   - The key to associate the variable value to
		VALUE - The variable value
		Example: t4copy -v threads=2 -v maxMemory=2GB -v path=\Program Files\
